    "* **Mitigation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Mini-batch discrimination:** Include batch-level diversity cues in D.\n",

    "  * **Proper hyperparameter tuning:** Learning rates, optimizers (Adam, RMSProp).\n",
    "  * **Gradient penalty / Wasserstein GAN:** Smoother loss functions for stable convergence.\n",
