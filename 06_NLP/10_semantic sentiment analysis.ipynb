    "# **1. Semantic Analysis in NLP**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Semantic analysis is the process of **understanding the meaning of text** (not just words).\n",
    "* Goes beyond syntax to identify **relationships, intent, and meaning**.\n",
    "* Answers: *What does the text actually mean?*\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD):** Identify correct meaning of words in context (*‚Äúbank‚Äù ‚Üí riverbank vs financial bank*).\n",
    "* **Semantic Role Labeling (SRL):** Identify who did what to whom (*John bought a car from Mary*).\n",
    "* **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Extract entities (*Apple ‚Üí company, Paris ‚Üí location*).\n",
    "* **Semantic Similarity:** Compare texts using embeddings.\n",

    "*A: Because syntax alone is insufficient. For example, ‚ÄúApple is a fruit‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúApple is a company‚Äù require semantic understanding to avoid ambiguity.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. What algorithms are commonly used for sentiment analysis?**\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Advanced**\n",

    "**Q5. How would you perform sentiment analysis on code-mixed or multilingual text?**\n",
    "*A: Use multilingual embeddings (e.g., mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa) or FastText subword embeddings. Alternatively, translate text first, then analyze sentiment.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. What challenges exist in sentiment analysis?**\n",
