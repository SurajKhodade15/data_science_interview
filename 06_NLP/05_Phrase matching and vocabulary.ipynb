    "## **1. Theory**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phrase Matching**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition**: Phrase Matching is the process of identifying **multi-word expressions** (MWEs) or predefined sequences of words in text.\n",
    "* Unlike simple word search, it finds **meaningful groups of words**.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "  Text: *‚ÄúHe lives in New York City and works at United Nations.‚Äù*\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Phrase matches: *‚ÄúNew York City‚Äù*, *‚ÄúUnited Nations‚Äù*.\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Useful in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Information extraction** (company names, drug names, legal terms).\n",
    "* **Domain-specific NLP** (medical jargon, financial terminology).\n",
    "* **Pattern-based rules** in chatbots.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Vocabulary**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition**: In NLP, vocabulary refers to the **set of unique tokens (words, subwords, or characters)** recognized by a model or system.\n",
    "* Acts as a **dictionary of known tokens** used during training/inference.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Text corpus: *‚ÄúCats play. Dogs play.‚Äù*\n",
    "  * Vocabulary: `{cats, play, dogs, .}`\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Types of Vocabulary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed Vocabulary** (traditional ML) ‚Üí Derived from training data (BoW, TF-IDF).\n",
    "2. **Subword Vocabulary** (modern NLP) ‚Üí Derived from tokenizers (BPE, WordPiece, SentencePiece).\n",
    "3. **Domain Vocabulary** ‚Üí Customized lists (medical, legal, finance).\n",

    "from spacy.matcher import PhraseMatcher\n",
    "\n",
    "nlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n",

    "for match_id, start, end in matches:\n",
    "    print(\"Matched Phrase:\", doc[start:end].text)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",

    "## **3. Interview-Style Q&A**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basic Level**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1. What is phrase matching in NLP?**\n",
    "*A: Phrase matching is the process of finding multi-word expressions or predefined word sequences in text, often used for entity or keyword extraction.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What is vocabulary in NLP?**\n",
    "*A: Vocabulary is the set of unique tokens (words, subwords, or characters) recognized and used by an NLP system or model.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Intermediate Level**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. How is phrase matching different from named entity recognition (NER)?**\n",
    "*A: Phrase matching relies on exact string matching or pattern rules, while NER uses statistical/machine learning models to detect entities even if they weren‚Äôt predefined.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Why is vocabulary size important in NLP models?**\n",
    "*A: Large vocabularies increase model size and complexity, while small vocabularies may lose expressiveness. Subword-based vocabularies balance efficiency and coverage.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advanced Level**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. How does SpaCy implement phrase matching?**\n",
    "*A: SpaCy provides a `PhraseMatcher` that matches document spans against a list of pre-defined Doc patterns, using hash-based lookups for speed and efficiency.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. How do modern NLP models like BERT handle vocabulary differently than Bag of Words?**\n",
    "*A: Instead of a fixed word-level vocabulary, BERT uses subword vocabularies (WordPiece). This reduces out-of-vocabulary issues and allows handling of rare/unknown words by splitting them into smaller meaningful units.*\n",
