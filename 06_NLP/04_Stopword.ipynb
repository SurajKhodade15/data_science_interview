    "## **1. Theory**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What are Stopwords?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stopwords** are common words in a language that usually do not carry significant meaning for analysis.\n",
    "* Examples in English: *is, the, a, an, in, of, and, to*.\n",
    "* They often appear **frequently** but don‚Äôt add much semantic value to tasks like classification or retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Remove Stopwords?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reduce dimensionality** ‚Üí fewer tokens to process.\n",
    "* **Improve efficiency** ‚Üí smaller vocabulary, faster models.\n",
    "* **Remove noise** ‚Üí focus on words with actual meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **When NOT to Remove Stopwords?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sentiment Analysis**: words like *‚Äúnot‚Äù*, *‚Äúnever‚Äù* are critical.\n",
    "* **Question Answering**: function words may matter.\n",
    "* **Language Modeling**: stopwords are essential for fluency.\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ So, stopword removal is **task-dependent**.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## **2. Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Using NLTK**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import nltk\n",
    "from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n",
    "from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n",
    "\n",
    "nltk.download(\"punkt\")\n",
    "nltk.download(\"stopwords\")\n",
    "\n",
    "text = \"This is an example showing the importance of stopword removal in NLP.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tokenization\n",
    "words = word_tokenize(text)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Stopword Removal\n",
    "filtered = [w for w in words if w.lower() not in stopwords.words(\"english\")]\n",
    "print(\"Filtered Tokens:\", filtered)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",

    "### **Using SpaCy**\n",
    "\n",

    "filtered = [token.text for token in doc if not token.is_stop]\n",
    "print(\"Filtered Tokens:\", filtered)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## **3. Interview-Style Q&A**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Basic Level**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q1. What are stopwords in NLP?**\n",
    "*A: Stopwords are commonly used words in a language, like ‚Äúthe‚Äù, ‚Äúis‚Äù, ‚Äúand‚Äù, which usually don‚Äôt add significant meaning in many NLP tasks.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. Why do we remove stopwords?**\n",
    "*A: To reduce dimensionality, improve computational efficiency, and focus on meaningful words.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Intermediate Level**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. Can removing stopwords ever harm performance?**\n",
    "*A: Yes, in tasks like sentiment analysis (‚Äúnot good‚Äù ‚Üí removing ‚Äúnot‚Äù changes meaning), or question answering, where stopwords may carry contextual importance.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. How do NLTK and SpaCy handle stopwords differently?**\n",
    "*A: NLTK provides a static predefined stopword list for different languages, while SpaCy has a built-in stopword set linked with its language models and also allows customization.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advanced Level**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. How do modern Transformer models treat stopwords?**\n",
    "*A: Transformers like BERT and GPT don‚Äôt require explicit stopword removal since embeddings capture contextual meaning, but preprocessing with stopword removal may still help in lightweight ML models.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. How would you customize stopword lists in practice?**\n",
    "*A: I would start with a default list (from SpaCy or NLTK) and then refine it based on domain needs ‚Äî for example, keeping ‚Äúnot‚Äù for sentiment tasks, or adding domain-specific filler words like ‚Äúsaid‚Äù in news corpora.*\n",
