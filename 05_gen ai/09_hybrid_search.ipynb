    "\n",
    "In a **RAG pipeline**, the goal is to augment an LLM (Large Language Model) with **external knowledge retrieval** to answer queries grounded in factual data.\n",
    "The retrieval component is **mission-critical**, as it determines what context is fed into the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **no single retrieval technique** (dense or sparse) is optimal for all query types. Hence, we blend them — resulting in **Hybrid Search**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ 2. Core Retrieval Paradigms\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break down the two retrieval modes before combining them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### a. **Sparse Retrieval (Lexical Matching — BM25, TF-IDF)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Works on **exact keyword overlap**.\n",
    "* Measures term frequency and document frequency.\n",
    "* Great for **precise queries** (“What is the interest rate in Q4 2024?”).\n",
    "* Fails when **semantic similarity** is required (“What was the last quarter’s borrowing cost?”).\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 **Example Algorithm:**\n",
    "`BM25`, `TF-IDF`, `Elasticsearch keyword search`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### b. **Dense Retrieval (Semantic Embeddings)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Converts documents and queries into **vector embeddings** using transformer-based models (e.g., `sentence-transformers`, `OpenAI embeddings`, `HuggingFace` models).\n",
    "* Measures **semantic closeness** via **cosine similarity** or **dot product**.\n",
    "* Excellent for **meaning-based retrieval**, even if the wording differs.\n",
    "* But it might miss **exact keyword matches** or numeric/symbolic cues.\n",

    "## ⚡ 3. The Hybrid Search Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hybrid Search** combines **Sparse (keyword-based)** and **Dense (semantic-based)** retrieval signals to achieve **robust and context-aware results**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Think of it as combining *precision* (lexical) with *recall* (semantic).\n",

    "## 🔬 4. How Hybrid Search Works (Conceptual Flow)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ingestion Phase:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Documents are embedded using a **dense model** (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) and **indexed** in a **vector database**.\n",
    "   * Parallelly, a **sparse representation** (e.g., BM25 term frequencies) is built and stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Query Phase:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * User query is processed through:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * **Sparse Encoder:** computes term-frequency-based vector (BM25).\n",
    "     * **Dense Encoder:** computes semantic embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Retrieval Phase:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Retrieve **top-k documents** from both sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * `dense_results` → semantic nearest neighbors.\n",
    "     * `sparse_results` → keyword-matched documents.\n",
    "   * Each document gets a **score** from both retrievals.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fusion Phase:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Merge both score sets using **weighted combination**:\n",
    "     [\n",
    "     score_{hybrid} = α * score_{dense} + (1 - α) * score_{sparse}\n",
    "     ]\n",
    "     where `α` is a tunable parameter (e.g., 0.5).\n",
    "   * Top results (highest hybrid score) are selected as **final retrieval output**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Augmentation Phase:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Retrieved documents are passed into the **LLM context window** to generate the final, grounded response.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Higher accuracy:** Improves retrieval F1 scores by 15–30% compared to single-mode search.\n",
    "* **Reduced LLM token usage:** Since the model receives more relevant context, it requires fewer retries.\n",
