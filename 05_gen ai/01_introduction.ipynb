    "# Introduction to Generative AI — End-to-End Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) Executive Summary\n",
    "- **What it is:** Generative AI (GenAI) refers to machine learning models (often deep neural networks) that can create new content—text, images, audio, code—based on patterns learned from data.\n",
    "- **Why it matters:** Enables automation of creative and knowledge tasks, boosts productivity, and unlocks new business models (chatbots, copilots, content generation, drug discovery).\n",
    "- **Where it fits:** At the top of the AI stack → consumes embeddings, knowledge bases, and prompts → produces natural-language or multimodal outputs.\n",

    "## 2) Conceptual Theory (Deep Dive)\n",
    "| Concept | Definition | Key Intuition | Math/Mechanics | Trade-offs |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| Generative AI | ML models that generate new data | \"Teach machines creativity\" | Trained via deep learning, typically transformers, VAEs, GANs | +Creative power / –Hallucinations |\n",
    "| Large Language Models (LLMs) | GenAI specialized in text | \"Next-word predictors\" | Probabilistic seq2seq models | +Natural text / –Bias, cost |\n",
    "| Diffusion Models | Image/audio generators | \"Reverse noise to clarity\" | Iterative denoising | +High-quality images / –Slow inference |\n",
    "| GANs | Generator vs Discriminator | \"Adversarial creativity\" | Minimax optimization | +Sharp outputs / –Training instability |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Workflow**\n",
    "1. Data Collection → high-volume, domain-specific corpora.\n",
    "2. Preprocessing → cleaning, tokenization, normalization.\n",
    "3. Model Training → transformer/GAN/diffusion architectures.\n",
    "4. Inference → sampling, decoding strategies (greedy, beam, nucleus).\n",
    "5. Deployment → APIs, copilots, assistants, embedded agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Pitfalls & Anti-Patterns**\n",
    "- Hallucinations (incorrect outputs) → *Mitigation:* RAG, grounding, eval sets.\n",
    "- Bias propagation → *Mitigation:* diverse data, fairness audits.\n",
    "- High cost → *Mitigation:* distillation, quantization, caching.\n",

    "| Question | Strong Answer (Concise) |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| What is Generative AI? | AI that creates new content (text, images, audio) by learning data distributions rather than just classifying them. |\n",
    "| Difference between discriminative vs generative models? | Discriminative → P(y|x), classify inputs. Generative → P(x), model distribution and generate samples. |\n",
    "| Why are transformers key to GenAI? | They capture long-range dependencies with attention, scale well, and support massive pretraining. |\n",
    "| What are challenges in GenAI deployment? | Hallucinations, bias, cost, latency, IP risks, data privacy. |\n",
