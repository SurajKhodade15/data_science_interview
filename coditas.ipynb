    "## **Topic: Prompt Engineering Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Definition & Importance**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** What is prompt engineering, and why is it critical in Generative AI?\n",
    "**A:** Prompt engineering is the strategic design and structuring of input queries to a Large Language Model (LLM) to elicit accurate, relevant, and contextually appropriate responses. It is crucial because LLMs are sensitive to prompt phrasing—subtle changes in wording can dramatically affect output quality, relevance, and creativity. Effective prompt engineering ensures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Minimization of hallucinations.\n",
    "* Alignment with desired output format (text, code, summary, etc.).\n",
    "* Efficient utilization of context and tokens.\n",
    "* Applicability across diverse domains like NLP, computer vision descriptions, code generation, and RAG pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Core Techniques in Prompt Engineering**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **A. Instruction Clarity**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** How do you design prompts for maximum clarity?\n",
    "**A:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **explicit instructions** specifying the task (e.g., “Summarize this text in three bullet points” instead of “Summarize this”).\n",
    "* Include **format constraints**, e.g., JSON output, tables, or specific sentence structures.\n",
    "* Provide **context** if needed to disambiguate terms or concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:*\n",
    "\n",
    "> Instead of: “Explain AI”\n",
    "> Use: “Explain AI in simple terms suitable for a non-technical audience, using one analogy.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **B. Role-based Prompting**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** What is role-based prompting, and why is it effective?\n",
    "**A:** Assigning the model a **persona or role** can improve relevance and tone. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* “Act as an experienced Gen AI engineer and explain…”\n",
    "* “You are a Python developer. Write code to…”\n",
    "  This guides the LLM’s style, technical depth, and assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **C. Few-shot and Chain-of-Thought Prompting**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** How do few-shot examples improve LLM performance?\n",
    "**A:** Providing **examples within the prompt** allows the model to generalize patterns and produce structured output. Chain-of-thought prompting encourages the LLM to reason step by step, reducing errors in complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example: Few-shot for math reasoning:*\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Q: 2+3=? A: 5\n",
    "Q: 7-4=? A: 3\n",
    "Q: 9*2=? A: \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The model follows the pattern to produce the answer `18`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **D. Context Window Management**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** How do you manage context effectively in LLM prompts?\n",
    "**A:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Provide only **relevant information** to avoid token overload.\n",
    "* Use **summaries or embeddings** for long documents (retrieval-augmented generation).\n",
    "* Maintain **conversation history** efficiently for chat-based LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **E. Iterative Refinement**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** What is iterative prompt refinement?\n",
    "**A:** This involves testing, evaluating, and refining prompts based on output quality. Key strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Modify wording, structure, or examples if output is off-target.\n",
    "* Introduce **explicit constraints** or counterexamples for clarity.\n",
    "* Use **temperature and max tokens tuning** to control creativity vs. precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **F. Output Control Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** How do you control the output format and style?\n",
    "**A:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Specify **format constraints**, e.g., “Respond in JSON with keys: name, age, profession.”\n",
    "* Use **enumeration**, e.g., “List 5 key points.”\n",
    "* Adjust LLM parameters like **temperature, top\\_p**, or **stop sequences** to control randomness and length.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **G. Prompt Testing Across Use Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** How do you ensure prompt robustness across diverse applications?\n",
    "**A:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Test multiple scenarios** (edge cases, ambiguous queries).\n",
    "* **Compare model outputs** under different phrasings.\n",
    "* **Integrate feedback loops** from users or downstream systems.\n",
    "* Use **prompt templates** for standardized tasks (summarization, question-answering, code generation).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Advanced Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Prompting:** Adjust prompts programmatically based on user input or context.\n",
    "2. **Recursive or Nested Prompting:** Use multiple LLM calls in a workflow for complex reasoning tasks.\n",
    "3. **Prompt Chaining:** Break complex tasks into smaller sub-prompts for better reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Best Practices**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keep instructions **concise but precise**.\n",
    "* Avoid ambiguous wording.\n",
    "* Use **few-shot examples** to improve output structure.\n",
    "* Test outputs iteratively and **optimize for token efficiency**.\n",
    "* Apply **role-based prompting** for domain-specific tasks.\n",
    "* Always validate critical outputs for **accuracy and safety**.\n",

    "### **5. Example Interview Scenario**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** How would you design a prompt for a model to extract key financial metrics from quarterly reports?\n",
    "**A:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define **task**: Extract revenue, net income, and expenses.\n",
    "* Specify **output format**: JSON with specific keys.\n",
    "* Provide **examples**: Include one or two sample reports with labeled outputs.\n",
    "* Apply **role-based prompting**: “Act as a financial analyst summarizing quarterly reports.”\n",
    "* Use **token management**: For long reports, combine summarization + extraction in steps (prompt chaining).\n",
