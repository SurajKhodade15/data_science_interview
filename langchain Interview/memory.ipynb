    "### **Q: How do you implement memory in LangChain (ConversationBuffer, ConversationSummary, VectorStore memory)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "In LangChain, **memory** refers to the ability of an LLM-powered application to **retain and use information across multiple interactions**. By default, LLMs are stateless‚Äîthey don‚Äôt remember previous prompts. LangChain introduces **Memory modules** that persist context so conversations feel natural, contextual, and personalized.\n",

    "### üîπ **Types of Memory in LangChain**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **ConversationBufferMemory**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Stores the raw conversation history (user + AI messages) in memory.\n",
    "  * Every new prompt includes the entire history appended.\n",
    "* **Pros:** Simple, maintains exact history.\n",
    "* **Cons:** Scales poorly as context grows ‚Üí can hit token limits.\n",
    "* **Use case:** Short, simple chatbots where full history is valuable.\n",
    "* **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory\n",
    "  memory = ConversationBufferMemory()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **ConversationSummaryMemory**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Instead of keeping all messages, it **summarizes past interactions** into a compact form using an LLM.\n",
    "  * Stores the running summary + last few exchanges.\n",
    "* **Pros:** Memory-efficient, avoids token overload.\n",
    "* **Cons:** Summarization may lose fine-grained details.\n",
    "* **Use case:** Long conversations (e.g., customer support, therapy chatbots).\n",
    "* **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory\n",
    "  memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **VectorStoreRetrieverMemory**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Stores past interactions as **embeddings in a vector database** (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate).\n",
    "  * At each turn, it retrieves the **most relevant past conversations** using semantic similarity.\n",
    "* **Pros:** Scales to thousands of interactions, retrieves only relevant parts.\n",
    "* **Cons:** Requires additional infra (vector DB).\n",
    "* **Use case:** Personalized assistants that must recall **specific past details** even after long gaps (e.g., ‚Äúremind me what I said about my favorite restaurant last month‚Äù).\n",
    "* **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  from langchain.memory import VectorStoreRetrieverMemory\n",
    "  from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS\n",
    "\n",
    "  memory = VectorStoreRetrieverMemory(\n",
    "      retriever=FAISS.load_local(\"chat_history\").as_retriever()\n",
    "  )\n",
