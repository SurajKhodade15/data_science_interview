    "### Q1. What is Logistic Regression?  \n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for **classification problems** when the target variable is **categorical (mostly binary: 0/1, Yes/No, True/False)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of fitting a straight line like linear regression, logistic regression uses the **sigmoid function** to output probabilities between 0 and 1.  \n",
    "- If probability > 0.5 → predict class 1, else class 0.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**  \n",
    "hθ(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z)), where z = wX + b  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Point:**  \n",
    "- Logistic Regression is used for **binary classification**.  \n",
    "- For multi-class classification → use **Softmax Regression**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. Difference between Logistic and Linear Regression  \n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "- **Linear Regression** → Target is continuous (e.g., predicting house price).  \n",
    "- **Logistic Regression** → Target is categorical (e.g., predicting if a customer will churn: Yes/No).  \n",
    "- Linear regression output is unbounded (-∞, ∞), while logistic regression output is **probability bounded between [0,1]**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. Why can’t we use Linear Regression for Classification?  \n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "- Linear regression outputs continuous values, which can go beyond 0 and 1 → not suitable for probabilities.  \n",
    "- Classification needs discrete classes. Logistic regression handles this by using **sigmoid/softmax** functions.  \n",
    "- Linear regression also fails when new samples shift the decision boundary unpredictably.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. What is a Decision Tree?  \n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "A decision tree is a **supervised learning model** used for both **classification and regression**.  \n",
    "- It splits data based on features using **if-else rules**.  \n",
    "- Internal nodes represent features, branches represent decisions, and leaves represent outcomes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:** Easy to interpret, handles categorical & numerical data.  \n",
    "**Drawback:** Can overfit easily → needs pruning or ensemble methods.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. Entropy, Information Gain, Gini Index  \n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "These are metrics to decide the **best feature to split** in a decision tree.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Entropy:** Measures impurity (0 = pure, 1 = impure).  \n",
    "- **Information Gain:** Reduction in entropy after a split. The higher the gain, the better the feature.  \n",
    "- **Gini Index:** Measures probability of misclassification (lower is better).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** CART algorithm uses Gini, ID3 uses Entropy & Information Gain.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. What is Pruning in Decision Trees?  \n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "Pruning reduces tree complexity by removing branches that add little value → prevents **overfitting**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pre-Pruning:** Stop tree growth early (e.g., set max depth, min samples split).  \n",
    "- **Post-Pruning:** Grow full tree, then remove weak branches based on error/complexity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. How do Decision Trees handle numerical and categorical data?  \n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "- **Categorical features:** Split by class membership.  \n",
    "- **Numerical features:** Split by threshold (e.g., Age > 30).  \n",
    "- In practice, categorical variables are often converted using **Label Encoding/One-Hot Encoding** before training.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "* **Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Bias-Variance Tradeoff is a **fundamental concept in machine learning** that explains the relationship between **model complexity, training error, and generalization error**.\n",
    "  * The main idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Bias** → Error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the model.\n",
    "    * **Variance** → Error due to sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training data.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Key Concepts**\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Bias**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * High bias → Model is too simple (underfitting).\n",
    "     * Cannot capture patterns in the data.\n",
    "     * Example: Using a linear model to fit highly non-linear data.\n",
    "  2. **Variance**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * High variance → Model is too complex (overfitting).\n",
    "     * Captures noise in the training data as if it were a pattern.\n",
    "     * Example: Deep decision trees that perfectly fit the training data but fail on new data.\n",
    "  3. **Irreducible Error**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Noise inherent in the data that no model can reduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tradeoff Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **High Bias + Low Variance** → Underfitting, poor accuracy on training and test data.\n",
    "  * **Low Bias + High Variance** → Overfitting, good training accuracy but poor test performance.\n",

    "* **Visual Intuition**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Imagine a target with arrows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * High bias → arrows far from the center but close to each other.\n",
    "    * High variance → arrows scattered around the center.\n",
    "    * Low bias & low variance → arrows tightly clustered around the center (ideal).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Strategies to Manage Tradeoff**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Reduce Bias** → Use more complex models, add relevant features, use non-linear algorithms.\n",
    "  * **Reduce Variance** → Regularization (L1/L2), ensemble methods (bagging, boosting), more training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Real-World Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Predicting house prices:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Simple linear regression → high bias, misses complex trends.\n",
    "    * Complex decision tree → low bias but overfits noise → high variance.\n",

    "\n",
    "  * Ensemble methods are **machine learning techniques** that combine predictions from **multiple models** (often called \"weak learners\") to produce a stronger, more accurate model.\n",

    "* **Key Intuition**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Think of it like asking multiple experts for their opinion instead of relying on one.\n",
    "  * Even if individual models make mistakes, combining them helps reduce errors and improve **robustness and generalization**.\n",

    "* **Types of Ensemble Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)**\n",

    "     * Train multiple models in parallel on **different random subsets** of data.\n",
    "     * Example: **Random Forest** (ensemble of decision trees).\n",
    "  2. **Boosting**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Train models **sequentially**, each new model focuses on correcting errors of the previous one.\n",
    "     * Examples: **AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM**.\n",
    "  3. **Stacking**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Train multiple models and then use a **meta-model** to combine their outputs.\n",
    "     * Example: Using logistic regression to combine predictions of SVM, decision tree, and KNN.\n",
    "  4. **Voting**\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Multiple models vote on the prediction; final decision is made by **majority (hard voting)** or **average probabilities (soft voting)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Advantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Improves **accuracy** compared to individual models.\n",
    "  * Reduces **overfitting** (especially bagging).\n",
