    "# ðŸ“Œ Basic Intro Statistics & Math Interview Q\\&A\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q1. What is the difference between Descriptive and Inferential Statistics?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Descriptive statistics** â†’ summarize and describe data (mean, median, std, variance).\n",
    "* **Inferential statistics** â†’ make predictions or inferences about a population using a sample (hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q2. What is the difference between Population and Sample? Why is sampling important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Population** â†’ the entire dataset (e.g., all users of Netflix).\n",
    "* **Sample** â†’ a subset of the population (e.g., 1,000 randomly selected Netflix users).\n",
    "* Sampling is important because analyzing an entire population is often impractical; the **Central Limit Theorem** ensures that sample means approximate normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q3. Explain Mean, Median, and Mode with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "For data: `[2, 4, 4, 6, 8]`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mean = (2+4+4+6+8)/5 = 4.8\n",
    "* Median = middle value = 4\n",
    "* Mode = most frequent value = 4\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ Interviewers may ask: *When would you prefer Median over Mean?*\n",
    "Answer: When data has **outliers or skewed distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q4. What is Variance and Standard Deviation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Variance** = average squared deviation from mean.\n",
    "* **Standard deviation (SD)** = square root of variance (in same units as data).\n",
    "  ðŸ‘‰ High variance/SD = data is spread out, low variance/SD = data is tightly clustered.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q5. What is Probability?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Probability measures the likelihood of an event occurring, ranging from **0 to 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: Tossing a fair coin â†’ P(Heads) = 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q6. What is Bayesâ€™ Theorem and why is it important in ML?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* It helps update probabilities when new evidence is available.\n",
    "* Widely used in **NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifiers, spam detection, recommendation systems**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q7. What are Type I and Type II Errors?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Type I Error (False Positive):** Rejecting a true null hypothesis.\n",
    "* **Type II Error (False Negative):** Failing to reject a false null hypothesis.\n",
    "  ðŸ‘‰ Example: In medical tests, a **Type I error** = diagnosing disease when patient is healthy; **Type II error** = missing a real disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q8. What is Correlation vs Covariance?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Covariance** â†’ measures how two variables vary together.\n",
    "* **Correlation** â†’ normalized version of covariance, always between **-1 and +1**.\n",
    "  ðŸ‘‰ Correlation is dimensionless and easier to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q9. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT)? Why is it important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* CLT states that the **sampling distribution of the sample mean** tends to be **normal**, regardless of population distribution, as sample size increases (n > 30 is a rule of thumb).\n",
    "* Importance: Enables us to apply **hypothesis testing, confidence intervals** in ML/AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q10. What is a Probability Distribution? Give examples.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A probability distribution describes how values of a random variable are distributed.\n",
    "* Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Discrete: Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson.\n",
    "  * Continuous: Normal, Exponential, Uniform.\n",
    "    ðŸ‘‰ Normal distribution is crucial in ML because many algorithms assume normality.\n",
    "\n",
