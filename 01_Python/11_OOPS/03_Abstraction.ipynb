    "# üîπ Abstraction in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:\n",
    "Abstraction is the process of **hiding implementation details** and exposing only the necessary functionality. It helps users focus on **what an object does** rather than **how it does it**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, abstraction is usually implemented using the `abc` module (Abstract Base Classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Abstract Class**: A class that cannot be instantiated directly.\n",
    "2. **Abstract Method**: A method declared but not implemented ‚Äî subclasses must override it.\n",
    "3. **Encapsulation vs Abstraction**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Encapsulation ‚Üí *restrict access to variables/methods* (data hiding).\n",
    "   * Abstraction ‚Üí *show only essential methods, hide implementation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Payment System\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Payment(ABC):   # Abstract class\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def pay(self, amount):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class CreditCardPayment(Payment):\n",
    "    def pay(self, amount):\n",
    "        print(f\"Paid {amount} using Credit Card.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class PayPalPayment(Payment):\n",
    "    def pay(self, amount):\n",
    "        print(f\"Paid {amount} using PayPal.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "payment = PayPalPayment()\n",
    "payment.pay(1000)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Here, `Payment` defines the **contract**, but the implementation is left to subclasses.\n",

    "# üîπ Interview Style Q & A on Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q1. What is abstraction in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Abstraction is hiding internal implementation and exposing only essential details. In Python, it‚Äôs done using abstract classes (`abc` module) and interfaces-like design.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q2. How is abstraction different from encapsulation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Encapsulation = **restrict access** (data hiding).\n",
    "* Abstraction = **hide implementation** (expose only what‚Äôs needed).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q3. How do you implement abstraction in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ By creating an abstract class with `@abstractmethod` decorators inside the `abc` module. Subclasses must implement those methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q4. Can we achieve abstraction without abstract classes in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Yes. Python supports *duck typing*. For example, instead of using abstract classes, we can assume that any object with the required method works:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    def speak(self): return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat:\n",
    "    def speak(self): return \"Meow!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def animal_sound(animal):\n",
    "    print(animal.speak())\n",
    "\n",
    "animal_sound(Dog())   # Works\n",
    "animal_sound(Cat())   # Works\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q5. Why is abstraction important in ML/AI projects?**\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Abstraction is critical in ML systems because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It separates **model API** from **implementation**.\n",
    "* Example: `fit()`, `predict()`, and `score()` in scikit-learn provide a **uniform interface**, while internal implementations vary (Logistic Regression vs Random Forest).\n",
    "* Makes ML pipelines modular and extendable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q6. Give an ML example of abstraction.**\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Suppose we define an abstract base for ML models:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class MLModel(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def train(self, X, y): pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def predict(self, X): pass\n",

    "class DecisionTree(MLModel):\n",
    "    def train(self, X, y):\n",
    "        print(\"Training Decision Tree\")\n",
    "    def predict(self, X):\n",
    "        print(\"Predicting with Decision Tree\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class NeuralNet(MLModel):\n",
    "    def train(self, X, y):\n",
    "        print(\"Training Neural Network\")\n",
    "    def predict(self, X):\n",
    "        print(\"Predicting with Neural Network\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ The user just calls `train()` and `predict()` without worrying about the implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q7. What happens if you don‚Äôt implement all abstract methods in a subclass?**\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Python raises a `TypeError` and prevents instantiation of the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Mini takeaway:**\n",
    "Abstraction = *‚ÄúHide the messy details, show only the necessary.‚Äù*\n",
    "In ML terms ‚Üí Think of `fit()` and `predict()` in sklearn: you don‚Äôt see the math, you just use the interface.\n",
