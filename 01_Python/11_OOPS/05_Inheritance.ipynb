    "**Definition:**\n",
    "Inheritance allows a class (**child/subclass**) to acquire the properties and behaviors (attributes & methods) of another class (**parent/superclass**).\n",
    "It promotes **code reuse, modularity, and extensibility**.\n",

    "## ‚úÖ Types of Inheritance in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Inheritance** ‚Äì child inherits from one parent.\n",
    "2. **Multiple Inheritance** ‚Äì child inherits from multiple parents.\n",
    "3. **Multilevel Inheritance** ‚Äì grandchild inherits from child which inherits from parent.\n",
    "4. **Hierarchical Inheritance** ‚Äì multiple children inherit from the same parent.\n",
    "5. **Hybrid Inheritance** ‚Äì combination of above (Python uses **MRO: Method Resolution Order** to resolve conflicts).\n",

    "## Example 1: Single Inheritance\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Q1. What is inheritance in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Inheritance allows a class to reuse attributes and methods of another class, enabling **code reuse and modular design**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q2. What are the types of inheritance in Python?**\n",

    "üëâ Single, Multiple, Multilevel, Hierarchical, and Hybrid.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q3. How does Python handle method conflicts in multiple inheritance?**\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Python uses **MRO (Method Resolution Order)**, which follows the **C3 linearization algorithm**.\n",
    "You can check it with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(Child.__mro__)\n",

    "\n",
    "üëâ\n",
    "\n",
    "* ML frameworks use inheritance for model design.\n",
    "* Example: In scikit-learn, all estimators inherit from `BaseEstimator`.\n",
    "* This ensures consistency across models (`fit()`, `predict()`, `score()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q5. Difference between inheritance and composition?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inheritance:** \"is-a\" relationship (Dog is an Animal).\n",
    "* **Composition:** \"has-a\" relationship (Car has an Engine).\n",
    "  üëâ Composition is often preferred in ML pipelines for flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q6. Can you prevent a class from being inherited?**\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Yes, by raising `TypeError` in `__init_subclass__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Final:\n",
    "    def __init_subclass__(cls, **kwargs):\n",
