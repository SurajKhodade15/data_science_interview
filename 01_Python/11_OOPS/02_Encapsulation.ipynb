    "# ðŸ”¹ Encapsulation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:\n",
    "Encapsulation is one of the four pillars of OOP. It refers to **wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class)** and controlling access to them. It helps in **data hiding** and ensures controlled interaction with the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## âœ… Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Public Members** â†’ Accessible everywhere.\n",
    "2. **Protected Members (`_variable`)** â†’ A convention that it should not be accessed directly outside the class.\n",
    "3. **Private Members (`__variable`)** â†’ Name mangling is applied (`_ClassName__variable`), making it harder to access directly.\n",
    "4. Encapsulation in Python is **not strict** (unlike Java/C++). It relies on **convention + name mangling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, account_number, balance):\n",
    "        self.account_number = account_number   # public\n",
    "        self._balance = balance                # protected\n",
    "        self.__pin = \"1234\"                    # private\n",
    "\n",
    "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "        self._balance += amount\n",
    "        print(f\"Deposited {amount}. New balance: {self._balance}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def withdraw(self, amount, pin):\n",
    "        if pin == self.__pin:\n",
    "            if amount <= self._balance:\n",
    "                self._balance -= amount\n",
    "                print(f\"Withdrawn {amount}. Balance: {self._balance}\")\n",
    "            else:\n",
    "                print(\"Insufficient funds\")\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Invalid PIN\")\n",
    "```\n",

    "# ðŸ”¹ Interview Style Q & A on Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q1. What is encapsulation in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods into a class while restricting direct access to some components. It helps in data hiding and maintaining integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q2. How is encapsulation different from data hiding?**\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ Encapsulation is the concept of binding data + methods together.\n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ Data hiding is achieved through encapsulation by controlling access levels (public, protected, private).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q3. How do you implement encapsulation in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ By using access modifiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Public (`variable`)\n",
    "* Protected (`_variable`)\n",
    "* Private (`__variable`) â†’ uses **name mangling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q4. What is name mangling in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ When you prefix an attribute with `__`, Python internally renames it to `_ClassName__variable` to avoid accidental access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Test:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.__hidden = \"secret\"\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = Test()\n",
    "print(obj._Test__hidden)   # Access via name mangling\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q5. Can we achieve true encapsulation in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ No, unlike Java or C++, Python does not enforce strict encapsulation. All members can still be accessed. Instead, Python uses **convention** (`_` and `__`) to indicate access restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q6. Why is encapsulation important in ML/AI projects?**\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ In ML/AI systems, encapsulation helps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hiding sensitive data like API keys, database credentials.\n",
    "* Packaging models with preprocessing logic inside a class.\n",
    "* Maintaining modular, clean, and secure code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q7. Give an ML-related encapsulation example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ Example: Encapsulating a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n",
    "\n",
    "class SpamClassifier:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self._model = LogisticRegression()  # protected\n",
    "        self.__trained = False              # private\n",
    "\n",
    "    def train(self, X, y):\n",
    "        self._model.fit(X, y)\n",
    "        self.__trained = True\n",
    "\n",
    "    def predict(self, X):\n",
    "        if not self.__trained:\n",
    "            raise Exception(\"Model not trained yet\")\n",
    "        return self._model.predict(X)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… **Mini takeaway:**\n",
    "Encapsulation = \"Safe packaging of data + methods.\"\n",
    "In Python â†’ achieved using naming conventions + OOP design.\n"
