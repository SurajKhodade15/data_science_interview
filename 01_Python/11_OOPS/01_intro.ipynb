    "## ðŸ”¹ **Python OOPs â€“ Interview Q\\&A**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q1. What are the four pillars of OOP? How does Python support them?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation** â†’ Bundling data + methods (e.g., class with attributes and functions).\n",
    "2. **Abstraction** â†’ Hiding implementation details (`abc` module).\n",
    "3. **Inheritance** â†’ Reusing code from parent classes.\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism** â†’ Same method behaves differently (method overriding, operator overloading).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q2. How do you define a class and object in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.name} makes a sound\"\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Animal(\"Dog\")   # object\n",
    "print(dog.speak())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q3. What is the difference between `__init__` and `__new__`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `__new__` â†’ creates a new instance (low-level, rarely overridden).\n",
    "* `__init__` â†’ initializes the instance after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q4. Explain inheritance with an example.**\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Q5. What is multiple inheritance in Python? How does it resolve conflicts?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "A class can inherit from multiple classes. Python resolves method conflicts using **MRO (Method Resolution Order)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class A: pass\n",
    "class B: pass\n",
    "class C(A, B): pass\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q6. What are class methods, static methods, and instance methods?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Instance method** (default): operates on object (`self`).\n",
    "* **Class method** (`@classmethod`): operates on class (`cls`).\n",
    "* **Static method** (`@staticmethod`): utility, no `self` or `cls`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Example:\n",
    "    def instance_method(self): pass\n",

    "    def static_method(): pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q7. What is polymorphism in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Method Overriding** â†’ child redefines parent method.\n",
    "* **Operator Overloading** â†’ redefine operators using special methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vector:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, x, y): self.x, self.y = x, y\n",
    "    def __add__(self, other): return Vector(self.x+other.x, self.y+other.y)\n",
    "\n",
    "v1, v2 = Vector(1,2), Vector(3,4)\n",
    "v3 = v1 + v2   # operator overloading\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q8. What are `__str__` and `__repr__`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `__str__` â†’ user-friendly string (for `print()`).\n",
    "* `__repr__` â†’ unambiguous string (for debugging).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q9. What is abstraction in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Implemented using `abc` module â†’ abstract base classes force derived classes to implement methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Model(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def train(self): pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q10. How is OOP used in AI/ML projects?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Models as classes (e.g., `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`).\n",
    "* Dataset loaders (`torch.utils.data.Dataset`).\n",
    "* Pipelines (encapsulation of preprocess â†’ train â†’ evaluate).\n",
    "* Reusable components (loss functions, optimizers, layers).\n",

    "# ðŸ”¹ Generalized OOP Interview Questions (Python-Focused)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q1. What is OOP and why is it important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that organizes code into **classes and objects**, making it modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.\n",
    "In Python, OOP is widely used in frameworks like **TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn** for building models and pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q2. How is Python different from other OOP languages like Java or C++?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python supports **multiple inheritance**, unlike Java.\n",
    "* Python has **dynamic typing**, so attributes can be added at runtime.\n",
    "* Access modifiers (`public`, `protected`, `private`) are **convention-based** in Python, not enforced like in C++.\n",
    "* Everything in Python is an object (even functions, modules, and classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q3. What is the difference between a class and an object?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Class** â†’ Blueprint (defines attributes and methods).\n",
    "* **Object** â†’ Instance created from the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand): self.brand = brand\n",
    "\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"Tesla\")  # Object\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `__new__` â†’ Creates a new instance (low-level).\n",
    "* `__init__` â†’ Initializes attributes of an object.\n",
    "* `__del__` â†’ Destructor, called when an object is deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q5. Explain the difference between class variables and instance variables.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Class variable** â†’ Shared across all objects of the class.\n",
    "* **Instance variable** â†’ Unique to each object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Example:\n",
    "    class_var = 0\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value): self.instance_var = value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q6. What is the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `@staticmethod` â†’ No access to class or instance (utility functions).\n",
    "* `@classmethod` â†’ Works on the class (`cls`) itself, not objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q7. What is the purpose of `self` in Python classes?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "`self` refers to the current object instance. It allows access to attributes and methods inside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q8. How does Python handle access modifiers?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Public â†’ normal names.\n",
    "* Protected â†’ `_single_underscore`.\n",
    "* Private â†’ `__double_underscore` (name mangling).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q9. What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Shallow Copy (`copy.copy`)** â†’ Creates a new object but references nested objects.\n",
    "* **Deep Copy (`copy.deepcopy`)** â†’ Recursively copies everything (independent clone).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q10. What are dunder (magic) methods in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Special methods with double underscores, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `__add__` â†’ Overloads `+`\n",
    "* `__len__` â†’ Used by `len()`\n",
    "* `__str__` â†’ String representation\n",
    "* `__getitem__` â†’ Indexing support\n",
