    "## ðŸ”¹ Python File Handling â€“ Interview Q\\&A\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q1. How do you open a file in Python? What are different modes?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "We use the built-in `open()` function. Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open(\"filename\", mode)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Common modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\"r\"` â†’ read (default)\n",
    "* `\"w\"` â†’ write (overwrites file, creates if not exists)\n",
    "* `\"a\"` â†’ append (adds data at end)\n",
    "* `\"x\"` â†’ create new file, error if exists\n",
    "* `\"b\"` â†’ binary mode (e.g., `\"rb\"`, `\"wb\"`)\n",
    "* `\"r+\"` â†’ read + write\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q2. What is the difference between `read()`, `readline()`, and `readlines()`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `read(n)` â†’ reads entire file (or `n` chars if given).\n",
    "* `readline()` â†’ reads one line at a time.\n",
    "* `readlines()` â†’ reads all lines and returns a **list**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"data.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n",
    "    print(f.read())      # entire file\n",
    "    print(f.readline())  # first line\n",
    "    print(f.readlines()) # list of lines\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q3. Why is `with open()` preferred over `open()`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "`with` automatically closes the file after the block, even if an error occurs.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"data.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n",
    "    content = f.read()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "No need for `f.close()`. This prevents resource leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q4. How do you write and append to a file?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Writing (overwrites)\n",
    "with open(\"file.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n",
    "    f.write(\"Hello Python\\n\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Appending\n",
    "with open(\"file.txt\", \"a\") as f:\n",
    "    f.write(\"Appended line\\n\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q5. Explain `tell()` and `seek()` in file handling.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `f.tell()` â†’ gives current file pointer position.\n",
    "* `f.seek(offset, whence)` â†’ moves pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `whence=0`: from beginning (default)\n",
    "  * `whence=1`: from current position\n",
    "  * `whence=2`: from end of file\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n",
    "    print(f.read(5))  # read first 5 chars\n",
    "    print(f.tell())   # â†’ 5\n",
    "    f.seek(0)         # reset to start\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q6. Whatâ€™s the difference between text mode and binary mode?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text mode** (`\"r\"`, `\"w\"`) â†’ Reads/writes strings, handles encoding.\n",
    "* **Binary mode** (`\"rb\"`, `\"wb\"`) â†’ Reads/writes raw bytes (useful for images, audio).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q7. How do you copy the contents of one file to another?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"source.txt\", \"r\") as src, open(\"dest.txt\", \"w\") as dest:\n",
    "    for line in src:\n",
    "        dest.write(line)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q8. How do you handle file exceptions in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    f = open(\"data.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "    print(f.read())\n",
    "except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    print(\"File does not exist\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    if f:\n",
    "        f.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q9. What happens if you open a file in `\"w\"` mode but it already exists?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "The file will be truncated (emptied). Any existing data will be lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q10. Can you iterate over a file object directly?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Yes, file objects are **iterators**, so you can loop line by line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"data.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n",
    "    for line in f:\n",
    "        print(line.strip())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q11. How do you read a huge file efficiently without loading everything into memory?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Use iteration or `readline()` in a loop instead of `read()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"bigfile.txt\") as f:\n",
    "    for line in f:\n",
    "        process(line)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q12. Explain `truncate()` in file handling.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "`f.truncate(size)` â†’ Resizes the file to given `size`. If no size, it truncates at the current pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q13. What are common interview coding challenges using file handling?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Count word frequency in a text file.\n",
    "* Remove duplicate lines from a file.\n",
    "* Merge two files into a third file.\n",
    "* Reverse the contents of a file.\n",
    "* Read a CSV file without using pandas.\n",
