    "**Answer:**\n",
    "NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **N-dimensional arrays (`ndarray`)** for efficient storage and computation.\n",
    "* **Vectorized operations** that are much faster than Python lists.\n",
    "* Mathematical functions for linear algebra, statistics, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use in AI/ML:** NumPy arrays are the backbone of ML data pipelines. Libraries like **Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn** internally rely on NumPy arrays for efficient computation.\n",
