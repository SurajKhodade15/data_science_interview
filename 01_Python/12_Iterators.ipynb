    "### **Definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "An **iterator** is an object that allows sequential access to elements, one at a time, without storing the whole collection in memory.\n",
    "It implements two magic methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `__iter__()` â†’ Returns the iterator object itself.\n",
    "* `__next__()` â†’ Returns the next element, raises `StopIteration` when done.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## âœ… Basic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "it = iter(my_list)   # get iterator\n",
    "\n",
    "print(next(it))  # 1\n",
    "print(next(it))  # 2\n",
    "print(next(it))  # 3\n",
    "# next(it) â†’ raises StopIteration\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## âœ… Custom Iterator Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Counter:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, low, high):\n",
    "        self.current = low\n",
    "        self.high = high\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __iter__(self):\n",
    "        return self\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __next__(self):\n",
    "        if self.current > self.high:\n",
    "            raise StopIteration\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            self.current += 1\n",
    "            return self.current - 1\n",
    "\n",
    "for num in Counter(1, 5):\n",
    "    print(num)   # 1 2 3 4 5\n",
    "```\n",

    "# ðŸ”¹ Interview Q & A on Iterators\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q1. What is the difference between iterable and iterator?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Iterable:** Any object that can return an iterator (e.g., list, tuple, dict, set). Has `__iter__()`.\n",
    "* **Iterator:** Object with a state that remembers where it is during iteration. Has `__iter__()` and `__next__()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q2. Why do we need iterators in AI/ML?**\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ Because datasets can be massive (e.g., ImageNet, streaming logs). Iterators let us:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load data lazily (one batch at a time).\n",
    "* Save memory instead of loading everything at once.\n",
    "* Enable **infinite streams** (good for online learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q3. What happens internally in a `for` loop?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calls `iter(obj)` â†’ gets iterator.\n",
    "* Calls `next(iterator)` repeatedly until `StopIteration` is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q4. What is the difference between `__iter__()` and `__next__()`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `__iter__`: Returns the iterator itself (used in `for` loop).\n",
    "* `__next__`: Returns next item, raises `StopIteration` when done.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Q5. How are iterators different from generators?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Iterators: Implemented via classes (`__iter__` + `__next__`).\n",
    "* Generators: Implemented via `yield` keyword (easier, more concise).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… **Mini takeaway:**\n",
    "Iterator = *object with a memory of where it left off*.\n",
    "In ML â†’ iterators are the backbone of **data pipelines** (batch loading, streaming, lazy evaluation).\n",
