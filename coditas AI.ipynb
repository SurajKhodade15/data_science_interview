    "## Introduction\n",
    "Hi, I’m Suraj, an AI/ML Engineer with 6+ years of IT experience, including 4 years in Generative AI, NLP, and ML. I specialize in building RAG-based applications with LangChain, Hugging Face, and vector DBs like FAISS/Chroma, and deploying them via FastAPI/Docker. At Globant, I built a Payroll Gen AI Assistant that reduced HR query tickets by 55%, and at CitiusTech, I led AI projects like fraud detection and semantic search recommenders. I’m passionate about designing scalable and reliable Gen AI systems, and I’m excited about this opportunity to apply my expertise to create impactful solutions."

On a query, a retriever fetched top-k documents, re-ranked them, and passed them into GPT-4 via LangChain. The response included citations for trust.

    "### **A:**\n",
    "“I see FAISS and Chroma as excellent for prototyping because they’re lightweight and easy to set up. However, they require manual handling for persistence and scaling. Pinecone and Weaviate, on the other hand, are enterprise-ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pinecone** is fully managed, cloud-native, and optimized for low-latency similarity search at scale, with strong metadata filtering.\n",

When upgrading, I re-embed documents with the new model, and during the transition phase, I dual-write queries to both the old and new indexes. Then, I run A/B tests to compare results and only cut over traffic once I’m confident the new embeddings maintain or improve accuracy. This ensures minimal disruption to end users.”\n",

For retrieval and LLM calls, I’d use async functions to handle concurrency efficiently. For heavier tasks like bulk embedding generation, I’d offload them to background workers using Celery with Redis. The service would be containerized with Docker, deployed behind Uvicorn/Gunicorn workers, and scaled with a load balancer. To optimize performance, I’d also add Redis caching for frequently asked queries.”\n",

    "### **Q:** If 1,000 users hit your API simultaneously, how do you scale?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **A:**\n",
    "“To handle that kind of load, I’d rely on async I/O to maximize concurrency and Redis caching to reduce repeated computation. Background tasks would be queued with Celery so they don’t block user queries. For scaling, I’d run the service in Kubernetes with horizontal pod auto-scaling based on CPU and memory metrics. If the LLM provider gets overloaded — for example, GPT-4 latency spikes — I’d implement a fallback to smaller, faster models for non-critical queries. Observability tools would monitor latency and throughput so we can proactively adjust scaling.”\n",

    "### **AI Interviewer:** Hi Suraj, welcome to this virtual interview. Let’s start with a quick introduction. Could you tell me a bit about yourself?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **You:**\n",
    "“Sure. I’m Suraj Khodade, an AI/ML Engineer with 6+ years of IT experience, including 4+ years in Artificial Intelligence and Generative AI. My expertise lies in building Gen AI applications using LangChain, Hugging Face, and OpenAI, with strong focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines, embeddings, and backend integration using Python frameworks like FastAPI. Recently, I’ve delivered production-grade solutions such as payroll query assistants, invoice summarization bots, and recommendation engines that improved efficiency and reduced manual workloads. I’m also certified in Azure Cloud and passionate about creating scalable and reliable AI systems.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **AI Interviewer:** Great. You mentioned Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Could you explain it in simple terms and share how you applied it in a project?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **You:**\n",
    "“Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG, enhances LLM responses by combining them with external knowledge from a vector database. Instead of the model relying only on its training data, it retrieves relevant context documents, embeds them, and feeds them into the LLM prompt.\n",
    "At Globant, I implemented a payroll Gen AI assistant where queries were answered using compliance and HR policy documents stored in Chroma DB. This approach reduced hallucinations and ensured context-aware, accurate answers.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **AI Interviewer:** Interesting. If you were asked to migrate from Chroma or FAISS to Pinecone, what would you evaluate before making that shift?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **You:**\n",
    "“I’d evaluate factors such as scalability, since Pinecone offers a managed cloud-native infrastructure; persistence and durability compared to FAISS; metadata filtering capabilities; latency and query performance; and overall cost of adoption. I’d also check how easily Pinecone integrates with LangChain for minimal disruption to the current RAG pipeline.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **AI Interviewer:** Let’s talk backend. Suppose you want to expose your RAG pipeline as an API. How would you structure it in FastAPI?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **You:**\n",
    "“I’d create a RESTful service with endpoints like `/query` for user input, `/add_documents` for ingestion, and `/healthcheck` for monitoring. Each endpoint would be asynchronous to handle concurrent requests efficiently. The flow would be: user query → embedding generation → vector DB retrieval → LLM response → structured JSON output. I’d also include middleware for logging, authentication, and error handling, and use Celery for background ingestion tasks. Finally, I’d containerize with Docker for deployment.”\n",
    "\n",

    "### **AI Interviewer:** Good. Now, let’s move to a bit of coding mindset. In your experience, how do you handle concurrency in Python when building APIs?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **You:**\n",
    "“For I/O-bound tasks, I use async/await with frameworks like FastAPI. For CPU-heavy operations, I prefer multiprocessing or background workers using Celery. For example, in a document ingestion pipeline, I used async DB calls for parallel inserts, ensuring the chatbot could still serve queries without being blocked.”\n",

    "### **AI Interviewer:** Let’s discuss a project. Tell me about the payroll assistant you built and its impact.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **You:**\n",
    "“I would first acknowledge their concerns and demonstrate explainability. For instance, in a fraud detection project, stakeholders were worried about black-box predictions. I introduced SHAP values to explain model outputs and ran a pilot with small datasets. This helped them build confidence in the system, and eventually, they agreed to scale it.”\n",

    "### **AI Interviewer:** Good response. One last question: How do you ensure your AI solutions are both maintainable and scalable?\n",

    "### **You:**\n",
    "“I follow clean code principles, SOLID design patterns, and modular architecture. I also integrate observability for logs, metrics, and tracing. For scalability, I containerize solutions with Docker, manage CI/CD pipelines, and design RAG workflows that can handle larger datasets. Finally, I ensure documentation and knowledge sharing so the solution is sustainable beyond my individual contribution.”\n",

    "\n",
    "### **AI Interviewer:** Hi Suraj, let’s continue. To begin, what excites you most about Generative AI, and why do you want to join Coditas?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **You:**\n",
    "“What excites me about Generative AI is its ability to transform unstructured data into actionable intelligence. I’ve seen its impact in domains like payroll and healthcare where automation reduces manual workload and improves accuracy. At Coditas, I see the opportunity to apply my skills in building scalable Gen AI products that combine strong backend engineering with cutting-edge AI research. Coditas’ culture of innovation and impact-driven projects aligns perfectly with my career goals.”\n",

    "\n",
    "### **AI Interviewer:** Can you explain the difference between fine-tuning an LLM and using embeddings with RAG? When would you choose one over the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **You:**\n",
    "“Fine-tuning adapts the base LLM by updating weights with domain-specific data, making it naturally better at certain tasks. However, it requires compute resources and retraining when knowledge changes.\n",
    "RAG, on the other hand, keeps the base LLM frozen but retrieves context from an external knowledge base at runtime. This is cost-effective and dynamic for rapidly changing data.\n",
    "I’d use fine-tuning for highly repetitive, domain-specific tasks like classification or summarization. I’d prefer RAG for dynamic knowledge domains, such as HR policies or finance regulations, where content changes frequently.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **AI Interviewer:** Imagine your RAG pipeline starts giving irrelevant results. What are the top three steps you’d take to debug it?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **You:**\n",
    "“First, I’d check embedding quality – ensuring the model used is appropriate for the domain. Second, I’d validate vector database indexing and confirm the right similarity metric (cosine, dot product, etc.). Third, I’d review the prompt construction to ensure retrieved context is properly injected. Tools like LangSmith also help in tracing where the pipeline fails.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **AI Interviewer:** Tell me about how you’ve used observability in LLM applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **You:**\n",
    "“In my payroll assistant project, I integrated LangSmith for observability. It allowed me to trace each query — from embedding generation to document retrieval and LLM response. I monitored latency, token usage, and accuracy of responses. Observability helped detect when the model was hallucinating or when retrieval was weak, enabling continuous improvement of the pipeline.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **AI Interviewer:** Let’s shift gears. How do you ensure API performance and scalability in Python backends?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **You:**\n",
    "“I optimize database queries with indexing and caching, use async frameworks like FastAPI to handle concurrency, and apply pagination to manage large responses. For scalability, I containerize with Docker, use load balancers, and apply CI/CD for deployments. Profiling tools like Pytest-benchmark or cProfile also help me tune bottlenecks.”\n",

    "\n",
    "### **AI Interviewer:** How would you integrate multimodal data, say text and images, into a Gen AI workflow?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **You:**\n",
    "“I’d use a multimodal embedding model like CLIP to generate vector representations of both text and images in the same embedding space. These embeddings can then be stored in a vector DB like Weaviate. When a query is made, similarity search retrieves both text and image context. The retrieved context is then passed into the LLM, enabling cross-modal reasoning.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **AI Interviewer:** You have experience with Docker. Suppose you are deploying a FastAPI + LangChain service. How would you set it up for production?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **You:**\n",
    "“I’d create a lightweight Dockerfile using Python slim base image, add dependencies, and expose the FastAPI app via Uvicorn/Gunicorn for production-grade performance. I’d configure environment variables for API keys, use volume mounts for logs, and add a healthcheck endpoint. The container would be deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service for scaling, with CI/CD pipelines managing updates.”\n",

    "### **AI Interviewer:** Let’s cover behavioral. Tell me about a time you had to quickly learn a new technology to deliver a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **You:**\n",
    "“At CitiusTech, I was primarily working in .NET when I was asked to lead a project involving Python-based ML workflows. I had limited exposure at the time, so I upskilled myself rapidly through hands-on prototyping, internal bootcamps, and weekend practice. Within a few months, I delivered a semantic search engine in Python that improved project-to-skill matching by 21%. That experience shaped my career transition into full-time AI/ML.”\n",

On the business side, I look at measurable impact such as reduction in manual workload, faster decision-making, or cost savings. For example, my payroll assistant reduced HR workload by 38% — that was a direct indicator of success.”\n",
