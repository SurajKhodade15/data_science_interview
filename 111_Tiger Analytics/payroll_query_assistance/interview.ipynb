    "# üöÄ **Storytelling Style Project Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Imagine an organization with over 10,000 employees, each having questions about salary slips, tax deductions, PF, or payroll compliance. HR teams often get bombarded with repetitive queries, wasting hours. To solve this, I designed a Payroll Gen AI Query Assistant ‚Äî an intelligent LLM-powered chatbot that provides context-aware, accurate answers to payroll and HR-related queries.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key elements of the project:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Problem Statement:** Employees had to wait for HR teams for payroll clarifications (tax deductions, overtime, salary slips, PF). Repetitive queries created inefficiency.\n",
    "* **Solution:** Built a **Generative AI chatbot** using **LangChain, OpenAI, Hugging Face models** with **Chroma DB** as a vector store for retrieving internal payroll policies and compliance documents.\n",
    "* **Observability:** Integrated **LangSmith** to trace prompts, monitor hallucinations, and improve reliability.\n",
    "* **Outcome:** Automated **38% of repetitive HR queries**, freeing HR to focus on high-value tasks. Employees got **instant, accurate, and personalized answers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tech Stack:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LangChain** ‚Üí for orchestration and chaining retrieval + LLM.\n",
