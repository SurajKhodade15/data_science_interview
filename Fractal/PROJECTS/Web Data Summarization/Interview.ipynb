    "# ✅ **Generative AI–Powered Web Data Summarization — Interview Q&A**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Can you explain your Web Data Summarization project?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This system automatically scrapes European energy project websites, extracts the content, and uses an LLM to generate a structured summary.\n",
    "It converts unstructured proposal pages into key fields like project name, duration, budget, location, objectives, and deadlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. What was the main business problem you were solving?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Energy project proposals are long, unstructured, and often vary in format.\n",
    "Manually extracting details is slow and inconsistent.\n",
    "The goal was to automate this extraction so analysts can quickly review project data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. What was your end-to-end pipeline?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps were:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Scrape project webpage using `requests` + `BeautifulSoup`.\n",
    "2. Clean and extract the main text.\n",
    "3. Send the extracted text to an OpenAI LLM.\n",
    "4. LLM generates a structured summary in JSON format.\n",
    "5. Parse the JSON and store/export it for analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Why did you choose BeautifulSoup for scraping?**\n",
    "\n",
    "BeautifulSoup is lightweight, simple, and works well for extracting specific sections of HTML.\n",
    "It handles messy pages and gives fine control over tags, text, and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. How did you deal with noisy webpages?**\n",
    "\n",
    "I removed scripts, styles, and unnecessary tags before extracting text.\n",
    "I also stripped extra whitespace and limited the character length to avoid sending too much noise to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. How did you ensure the summaries were structured?**\n",
    "\n",
    "I designed a strong system prompt that instructed the LLM to return a strict JSON with fields like:\n",
    "`project_name, location, duration, start_date, budget, objectives`\n",
    "This enforces consistency across different webpages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. What information did the model extract from proposals?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Common fields included:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Project name\n",
    "* Country\n",
    "* Duration\n",
    "* Start date\n",
    "* Funding program\n",
    "* Budget\n",
    "* Key objectives\n",
    "* Key activities\n",
    "* Website URL\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. What LLM models did you use?**\n",
    "\n",
    "I used OpenAI GPT models because they handle long context and provide accurate semantic understanding.\n",
    "Models like GPT-4o-mini or GPT-3.5 were sufficient for structured extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. How did you manage long webpages exceeding token limits?**\n",
    "\n",
    "I truncated to a maximum character limit (e.g., 5k–8k) before sending to the LLM.\n",
    "This removes footer/menu noise and keeps only the meaningful content.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **10. How did you handle missing fields in the webpage?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If a field wasn’t available, the LLM was instructed to output `\"Unknown\"` instead of fabricating information.\n",
    "This prevents hallucinations and keeps the dataset clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **11. Did you face any challenges in scraping?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, some websites had dynamic content or inconsistent structure.\n",
    "I solved this by using flexible selectors and fallback methods to extract text.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **12. Why not use a rule-based parser instead of an LLM?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Webpages had inconsistent HTML layout.\n",
    "A rule-based parser would break frequently.\n",
    "An LLM is resilient to unstructured data and can extract meaning regardless of formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **13. How did you validate the LLM output?**\n",
    "\n",
    "I parsed the JSON response and checked each field for basic correctness.\n",
    "I also manually validated several samples to ensure accuracy before full-scale use.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **14. How scalable is your solution?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It can run in parallel for multiple URLs, since scraping and LLM summarization are independent.\n",
    "With batching and async requests, you can scale to hundreds of pages per hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **15. How would you productionize this system?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Wrap it in FastAPI\n",
    "* Use async scraping\n",
    "* Add retry logic\n",
    "* Store extracted summaries in a database\n",
    "* Add monitoring for LLM cost and errors\n",
    "* Use a message queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for batch processing\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **16. What improvements would you make in the next version?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add multi-page crawling\n",
    "* Add a hybrid summarization (extractive + generative)\n",
    "* Integrate with a vector database for project search\n",
    "* Add a dashboard for analysts\n",
    "* Add automated scheduling with cron or Airflow\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **17. What was the final output format?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A clean JSON containing all key fields.\n",
    "Easy to store, analyze, or feed into Excel, Power BI, or downstream systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **18. What impact did this create?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysts no longer had to manually read long proposal documents.\n",
    "The system reduced manual extraction time significantly and enabled faster decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **19. What is unique about your approach?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It combines traditional web scraping with LLM-based structured extraction,\n",
    "making the system both robust to layout changes and flexible for complex content.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **20. How does this project demonstrate your GenAI skills?**\n",
    "\n",
    "It shows ability to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Integrate LLMs with Python pipelines\n",
    "* Design structured prompts\n",
    "* Work with unstructured data\n",
    "* Build automated extraction workflows\n",
    "* Apply GenAI to real-world business problems\n",
